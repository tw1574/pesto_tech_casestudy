1. Data Ingestion: Use Apache Kafka as a scalable data ingestion system. Implement data producers that push ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro) data to separate Kafka topics. Kafka can handle high volumes of real-time and batch data.

2. Data Processing: Use Apache Flink to consume data from Kafka topics. Flink is a stream processing framework that can handle real-time data processing. Implement Flink jobs to consume data from Kafka, process it, and then store it in a database. The processing can include data validation, filtering, deduplication, and correlation of ad impressions with clicks and conversions.

3. Data Storage and Query Performance: Use a scalable database system like PostgreSQL for storing the processed data. Depending on your query requirements, you might want to use a NoSQL database like Cassandra or a columnar storage like Redshift for analytical queries. Index the tables properly to optimize for query performance.

4. Error Handling and Monitoring: Implement error handling in the Flink jobs to handle any errors during data processing. Use a monitoring system like Prometheus to monitor the system and Grafana for visualization. Set up alerts for any anomalies, discrepancies, or delays in the data.
